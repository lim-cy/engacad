                  Are you still here? I'll do my best then. ('-'*ゞ
                    <br><br>
                  Step 1:Download and install Github Desktop(I assumed you already did so?)
                  <br><br>
                  Step 2: Sign in to your Github account (no pictures for these steps cause I already did them)

                            <p> Downloading Github Desktop made updating the website a lot easier. I
                              didn't need to keep uploading files to Github and it only took a few quick clicks to update the files in Github. As
                              it automatically senses any changes I made, I only need to commit and then push to make the change.

                            </p>

                    <div style ="overflow: hidden; position: relative;">
                      <br>
                      <p> I used the <a href = "https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.4/css/"> Bootstrap CSS framework </a> to have my images and text
                      side-by-side in the projects post(it's used for most of my formatting). Bootstrap is also used for the navigation bar. Since the Projects page is in a blog layout, I
                      intend to just keep adding new "posts" by copy-pasting and then editing sections of the code for new entries.
                      I used <a href ="https://fonts.google.com/"> Google Fonts </a> for more font options. (Hi, so I'll rewrite
                      the website using Bootstrap 4/5 but for now, it's using Bootstrap 3, sorry!) So I'll document my process rewriting both the HTML and CSS later _(꒪ཀ꒪」∠)_
                      <br><br>
                      Now for the in-depth on how I built this. Let's start with the navigation bar!
                      <img src="images/NavBar.jpg" class="img-responsive">
                      "navbar-fixed-top" makes the navigation bar stay fixed at the top of your screen regardless of
                      scrolling, moving along with it.(Use "navbar-static-top" if you would rather have the navigation bar not move)
                      The three "span class" tags make the three line menu that you will see on mobile view
                      (Try viewing my website on mobile! It looks <del>good</del> passable!)
                      Engineering Academy is under "navbar-brand" so that I can edit it separately from the list items
                      Use "a href=" to link all the text to their respective pages and that's all for the navigation bar!
                      <br><br>
                      Now let's talk about the footer!
                      <img src="images/Footer.jpg"class="img-responsive">
                      Nothing really special here. Most of my CSS is in my CSS script so you won't see much here. The "script src" are for my
                      Bootstrap CSS framework. Without, it the 3 line menu wouldn't work on mobile but that's about what it does for my website for now.
                      <br><br>
                      On to the text that you see in both my Home page and About Page!
                      <img src="images/TextDiv.jpg"class="img-responsive">
                      Pretty much standard stuff. "class=img-responsive" makes it such that the images will scale accordingly to device size.  (Again, try
                      it on mobile to see the effect! Or just resize your browser it works too) The "del" tags basically do <del>strikethroughs</del>. I
                      think I am abusing them.
                      <br><br>
                      Finally how one of my "posts" look like on the Project Page.
                      <img src="images/ProjectPost.jpg"class="img-responsive">
                      Same stuff as before. Lots of divs for formatting, can be a bit hard to keep track but quite easy as long as I comment where it starts
                      and ends. The "div id=white" is to change the background colour of the posts which if you scroll down will see alternate between
                      grey and white. That's it for how I built this site! I don't think I'll be covering the CSS unless it's required?

                          <p>Here's some of the Fusion360 work that I have done. There's a laser-cut handphone holder that is shaped
                            like a TV set and a 3D-printed desktop organiser. I learnt a lot about Fusion360 through this two assignments.

                              <li>Rectangular Pattern - Super useful for making any type of woodwork joints, essentially
                                a copy paste function in any direction</li>
                              <li>Check for interference(under Inspect) - When trying to piece together parts for a laser cut object,
                                helpful for checking for interference so that you know whether hole/parts are correctly sized/angled</li>
                              <li>Shell - Best tool for making drawers enough said </li>
                              <li>Offset Plane - Useful when used in conjunuction with align for moving objects to a set position that is hard
                                to do by mouse alone</li>
                              <li>Motion Study - Really nice to see how joints move</li>
                              <li>Animation - Animate how your object should be assembled</li>

                            </ul>

                                most of the tools in CADD. It was nice to just have fun with the software and not be stressed about doing up a nice assignment. Printing our own designs were really special as we got to customize our shirts - making
                                each of them unique. Designing it together with my tablemates made for a whole load of fun as we got to see each other's ideas and bounce off one another.
